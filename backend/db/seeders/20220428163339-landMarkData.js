An elevator carries visitors to the observation deck in the pedestal, which may also be reached by stairway, and a spiral staircase leads to an observation platform in the figure’s crown. A plaque at the pedestal's entrance is inscribed with a sonnet, “The New Colossus” (1883) by Emma Lazarus. It was written to help raise money for the pedestal, and it reads:",

Opened in 1973, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site as of June 27, 2007. Situated on Bennelong Point in Sydney Harbor, with park land to its south and close to the equally famous Sydney Harbour Bridge, the building and its surroundings form an iconic Australian image. It is also famous for lengthy delays in its completion, huge cost overruns, and a stormy relationship between designer and client which led to Utzon's resignation from the project in 1966 before its completion.",

The project was plagued with interruptions, as engineers sought solutions to the leaning problem, but the tower was ultimately topped out in the 14th century. Twin spiral staircases lined the tower’s interior, with 294 steps leading from the ground to the bell chamber (one staircase incorporates two additional steps to compensate for the tower's lean). Over the next four centuries the tower's seven bells were installed; the largest weighed more than 3,600 kg (nearly 8,000 pounds). By the early 20th century, however, the heavier bells were silenced, as it was believed that their movement could potentially worsen the tower's lean.",
